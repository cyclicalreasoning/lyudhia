There are gems in here that I would never write today (have left everything undated for fun :D).\n\nAnyway. Enjoy. Hope you have fun.

Before I get cold feet, some things to start (musings \u0026 affection)\n\nthis page is alive! updateable \u0026 timeless. this can be so much more -- more than words on a screen, more than a glorified love letter, this can be a whole and authentic representation of us! changing as we change, growing as we grow.
